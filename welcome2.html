                    <p> Omnicorps was created in XX23 by our government, the founders of North Turtle Island. Before, North Turtle Island was at the mercy of the South Turtle Island since all major online services such as social networking, online shopping, film & television streaming, videogame platforms, were provided through the internet by tech companies based in the neighboring country. But our government took initiative and took Omnicorps, that use to be a conglomerate monopoly and turned it into the company we are today!</p>
